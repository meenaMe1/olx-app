How does sonar scanner know where is sonar server ? Configure in sonar-scanner.properties
 
In bin folder, StartSonar.bat file is used to start SOnarqube server on your local windows machine
 
In case of maven project, we dont need to run sonarqube scanner along with server as we can include sonarqube scanner
(sonar maven) plugin in settings.xml file of maven or pom.xml file of your project. If we do it in settings.xml, we don't
need to configure for every project seperately which would be the scenario in case of configuration in pom.xml
 
In case of PHP / Angular project, we need to manually run sonarqube scanner alongwith sonarqube server.
 
-------------------------------------------------------------
 
Add new project in top right create new project. It asks for project key and displayname. Project key is unique key 
and displayname is just used at the time of display. 
 
Provide token screen appears. We have to generate a token (autogenerated or we can provide any exisitng token stored by us as well); 
so that sonar scanner gets sort of credential to access the system
on which it has to perform the scanning.
 
Select your project's technology and build tool
 
For running Sonarqube analysis with maven,
do mvn sonar:sonar -> 1st is the name of plugin and 2nd is the goal
Also provide some other options 
-Dsonar.projectKey=  Provide project key
-Dsonar.host.url= Provide sonar server URL
-Dsonar.login= Provide token generated 2 steps back.
 
If you don't want to provide these options everytime while doing mvn sonar:sonar, we can create all configurations inside
a file sonar-project.properties; which would be created in the root directory of my project.
